      <h2> How does Open Source software sustain?</h2>

One of the questions which can be raised about open-source software is how can they sustain and the companies that maintain them won’t go out of business. This blog which is condensed from this <b><a href="https://blog.timescale.com/blog/how-open-source-software-makes-money-time-series-database-f3e4be409467/">page</a></b> will help in answering this question.
	<br>
	<br>

		<p><b> But first, there are two requirements every open-source company needs before it can even consider making money.</b></p> 
		<h4> #1: Broad Adoption/ broad userbase: </h4> 
		<p>Broad adoption is necessary because an open-source company can capture only a small amount of the value it creates. To be clear: an open-source company gives most, if not all, of its developed software away for free, and most of its users will never pay for that software.

		</p>
		<h4> #2: Primary Credibility</h4> 
		<p>Having “primary credibility” means that anyone who needs help with the software reaches out to the open-source company and not someone else for assistance.
			This is important because it enables the open-source company to build an efficient sales and marketing process, which is especially important given the low monetization rates.			
		</p>
		
		<p><i>Now let’s take a look at some of the business models.</i>
		</p>
		<h4> #1: Dual-licensing / Open-core:</h4> 
		<p>Oftentimes, open-source companies will dual-license their software, offering free versions as well as enterprise editions
			The idea behind open-core is that the majority of the code base is open-source, while a smaller percentage (targeted at production or enterprise users) is proprietary.
			Typically the proprietary features are ones needed for production deployments and/or at a scale which could be monetized.
			
		</p>

		<h4> #2: Paid Support</h4> 
		<p>Open-source software itself is free. But in order to feel the need to pay for support, a company needs to rely on the project for mission-critical systems. Usually servicies like deployment and integration services, production-oriented “insurance policies”, certified binaries, trainings, bug fixes are sold to businesses deploying the project in production.
			<br>
			<i>(Note: This model is also notoriously inefficient, typically converting less than 1% of all users into paying customers.)</i>
			</p>
			

		<h4> #3: Hosting </h4> 
		<p>Hosting means offering a fully-managed version of your project so that when users want to try out the project, or even deploy it in production, they can spin up a remote server with the software in just a few clicks, and not have to worry about operating it in steady-state, this has also become a popular model for public cloud providers to monetize open-source projects (like AWS)
		</p>

		<h4> #4: Restrictive licensing</h4> 
		<p>The restrictive licensing model creates a legal reason for users of open-source software to pay. It does this by providing an open-source license with slightly onerous terms, such that anyone using the software in production is highly incentivized to strike a commercial deal with the vendor.
		</p>
		<h4> #5: Hybrid Licensing</h4> 
		<p>Hybrid licensing takes the open-core approach but improves on it in a few key ways. What hybrid licensing does is intermingle open-source and proprietary software in the same repository, and then make the code for the entire repo available.</p>
		<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
		<p style="font-size: 90%;">While there are several businesses model, yet there is no one-size-fits-all. That said, most open-source companies will make money using a combination of the five models we discussed, forming a revenue layer cake. For example, by combining support and licensing, or support and hosting and open-core.
			And hopefully, this post would also serve to clear the misconception that open source is equivalent to cost-free.
