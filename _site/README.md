# Hello-FOSS-webdev 

Hello There!   

Hello FOSS is a *festival* organised by [WnCC](https://www.wncc-iitb.org/), IITB and [DevCom](http://devcom-iitb.org/), IITB to encourage the culture of Open Source in our insti. We promise there's something for everyone. Okay, time for some background before getting started.    
There's this initiative called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by Digital Ocean all over the world to encourage participation in the open source community. There's a challenge, on whose completion they award you with a limited edition tshirt and schwag. We wanted to help y'all get started with Open Source, but given the academic load this semester, thought that now might not be a good time. But, with Hacktoberfest running along side, we hope your enthusiasm to learn Open Source fueled by the motivation to complete this year's challenge, this might turn out to be a successful endeavour afterall.  

Open Source can be daunting at first, How would I get started? Will they accept me? Will ..anyone accept me?    
Relax! If you're clueless, watch this recent introductory session by us - [Panel Discussion with GSoCers](https://youtu.be/UtmGnnutXeo)

### The Website

This is the repository for the official website of WnCC's Hello-FOSS festival. The website itself is hosted [here](https://hellofoss.wncc-iitb.org/index.html). The website is open source and we welcome contributions from all. You can contribute to this website in the following ways:

- Write a blog to add to our ["Community Blogs"](https://hellofoss.wncc-iitb.org/blogs.html). The main purpose of Open Source is to grow by learning from others' experiences and mistakes rather than starting from scratch. Use this "Community Blog" to learn from others and also help others grow. Best suggestion for one's first blog is the errors he/she faced while installing Jekyll, cause most of us face similar installation issues.
- Add a Contributors section which can be a new tab in the menu. This section can contain cards of all the contributors and brief details to the contributions made by them under Hello-FOSS. After making a contribution to any project under Hello FOSS, don't forget to update it here too
- Bug fixes of any kind, improvements, suggestions all are welcome.
- Design a favicon icon for  Hello-FOSS, first of its kind festival celebrating open source.
